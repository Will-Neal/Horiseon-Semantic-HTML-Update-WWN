# HORISEON SEO UPDATE

## SEO and Accessibility Optimization

The Horiseon website has been updated for better search engine optimization as well as better accessibility for people who enjoy the webpage in non-traditional manners. This has the added benefit of making the code easier to read and maintain in the future. 

To do this, we have **refactored** the existing code. This means we have updated it without changing the actual function except in places where the site was not working as intended. 

## Changes 

Generic div tags have been modified to better represent the content they contain. For example div tags were changed to header for the heading of the page, nav tags for the navigation bar, footer tags for the footer of the page, section and article tags for the three articles that constitute the main content of the page and aside tags for the side bar. 

## Fixes 

Alternate text was added to all photos where it was previously missing. This will ensure that people who cannot see the pictures for various reasons will be able to still reasonably enjoy this content. The navigation bar was fixed so that the tabs all properly link to their desired target.The navigation links were also moved to the navigation bar. Lastly, the background in the Online-Reputation section was adjusted so that the type does not hang off of the background. 


## Webpage Deployment
